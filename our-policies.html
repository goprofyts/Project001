Even though this industry is one of the few where one can write their own check in terms of earnings, there is no guarantee that you will earn any money using the techniques and ideas in this product.
<div>
</div><div>Examples in these materials are not to be taken as a promise or guarantee of earnings. Earning potential is entirely dependent on the person using our product, ideas, techniques and the effort put forth. We do not purport this as a "get rich scheme", and nor should you view it as such.
</div><div>
</div><div>Your level of success in attaining the results claimed in our materials depends on the time you devote to the system, knowledge and various skills. Since these factors differ according to individuals, we cannot guarantee your success or income level.
</div><div>
</div><div>Any and all forward looking statements here or on any of our sales material are intended to express our opinion of earnings potential. Many factors will be important in determining your actual results and no guarantees are made that you will achieve results similar to ours or anybody else’s, in fact no guarantees are made that you will achieve any results from our system.
</div><div>
</div><div>Results vary, and as with any money-making opportunity, you could make more or less. Success in ANY money-making opportunity is a result of hard work, time and a variety of other factors. No express or implied guarantees of income are made by GoProfyts program.

On a sidenote we do ask you to put the techniques into use before requesting a refund, for both our benefit: however, our refund policy is unconditional and this is a suggestion, not a requirement. We are aware that some buyers will not achieve their personal goals despite our best efforts to the contrary, and we stand by our refund policy as such. Please forward your receipt number (given to you when you ordered) to us and we will action your refund request as quickly as possible, typically within 24 hours.&nbsp;</span></div><div>
</div><div>Please be advised that in some cases we may revoke your refund request! Unlike a physical product, when you get access to a digital product and use it, it will be always in your hands even when you get a refund and "return" it. And to protect ourselves as a merchant from "online fraud" and "friendly abuse", we might reject your refund request if we detected that your request is suspesious!</div><div>
</div><div>As we mentioned above we advise you to try the program and its techniques for enough time before requesting a refund. You have 60 days in your hands.</div></div>
